# Task Overview
You are working on a dashboard application featuring a user Preferences panel with toggles for 'Enable Notifications' and 'Dark Mode'. Currently, these toggles do not reliably remember user preferences across reloads, and dark mode changes are not reflected instantly in the dashboard's background.

# Guidance
- The preferences toggles should initialize their state from the browser's persistent storage, with default values set to off if no prior preference exists.
- All preference changes must be saved persistently so that user choices remain consistent across navigation and reloads.
- Instant and clear visual feedback must be shown for any toggle state change, including immediately updating the dashboard background when dark mode is toggled.
- UI controls must be accessible and offer clear cues regarding the current state.

# Objectives
- Preferences panel toggles initialize from persistent storage and default to off if unset.
- Any toggle change is instantly reflected visually and immediately stored persistently.
- The dashboard background updates its theme immediately when switching dark mode.
- UI and toggles meet accessibility standards.

# How to Verify
- The toggles correctly load the last saved state from persistent storage, defaulting to off if no preference is found.
- Changing either toggle gives immediate visual feedback and reliably saves the preference for the next reload or navigation.
- The dashboard's background and theme change instantly and persistently with the dark mode toggle.
- The UI controls are fully accessible and reflect their current state appropriately.
